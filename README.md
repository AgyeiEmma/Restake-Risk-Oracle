# Restake-Risk-Oracle
A restaking-native risk analysis and rebalancing protocol for Swellchain and EigenLayer AVSs. Calculates real-time AVS risk scores, visualizes exposure, and automatically reallocates restaked assets like rswETH to optimize yield vs. slashing risk. Built for the Swellchain hackathon.
